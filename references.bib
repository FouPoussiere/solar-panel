  abstract = {Accurate detection of photovoltaic (PV) module defects requires integrating information from multiple sensing modalities, as single-image approaches often fail under real-world variability. This paper proposes a multimodal segmentation framework that fuses RGB, infrared (IR), and electroluminescence (EL) imagery within a modified Mask R-CNN architecture. RGB provides structural and surface context, EL captures subsurface micro-cracks, and IR contributes complementary thermal signatures associated with hotspots, cell mismatch, and localized heating fault characteristics that cannot be observed in RGB or EL alone. A dedicated alignment pipeline based on homography and ECC refinement ensures geometric consistency across modalities, while a feature-level Fusion Attention Block adaptively combines modality-specific features. Hyperparameters and fusion weights are automatically tuned using the HawkFish Optimization Algorithm (HFOA), improving stability and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on statistically paired RGB–EL–IR datasets demonstrate that incorporating IR imagery significantly enhances the detection of thermally driven defects and reduces false negatives in low-contrast regions. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming the value of thermal information in multimodal PV inspection.},

  abstract = {Solar panels are critical for renewable electricity generation, yet defects significantly reduce power output and risk grid instability, necessitating reliable AI-driven defect detection. We propose the SPHERE (Solar Panel Hidden-Defect Evaluation for Renewable Energy) method for such cases. This study compares deep learning models for classifying solar panel images (broken, clean, and dirty) using a novel, proprietary dataset of 6079 images augmented to enhance performance. The following three models were evaluated: YOLOv8-m, YOLOv9-e, and a custom CNN with 9-fold cross-validation. Pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16 and ResNet) were assessed but outperformed by YOLO variants. Metrics included accuracy, precision–recall, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity. YOLOv8-m achieved the highest accuracy (97.26\%) and specificity (95.94\%) with 100\% sensitivity, excelling in defect identification. YOLOv9-e showed slightly lower accuracy (95.18\%) but maintained high sensitivity. The CNN model demonstrated robust generalization (92.86\% accuracy) via cross-validation, though it underperformed relative to YOLO architectures. Results highlight YOLO-based models’ superiority, particularly YOLOv8-m, in balancing precision and robustness for this classification task. This study underscores the potential of YOLO frameworks in automated solar panel inspection systems, offering enhanced maintenance and grid stability reliability. This contributes to advancing AI applications in renewable energy infrastructure, ensuring efficient defect detection and sustained power output. The dataset’s novelty and the models’ comparative analysis provide a foundation for future research in autonomous maintenance solutions.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the solar photovoltaic industry, the efficient and stable operation of PV modules is crucial for the reliability of energy systems. However, PV panels are prone to various defects such as cracks, micro-cracks, and hot spots during manufacturing, installation, and operation, which can significantly reduce power generation efficiency and shorten equipment lifespan. Therefore, fast and accurate defect detection has become a vital technical demand in the industry. This paper proposes a lightweight PV defect detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv11n architecture. Building upon the original YOLOv11n framework, two modules are introduced to enhance model performance: (1) the CFA module (Channel-wise Feature Aggregation), which improves feature representation of subtle defects through the integration of context and local pathways, channel attention guidance, and residual correction mechanisms; and (2) the C2CGA module (Cross-Channel and Cross-Group Attention), which strengthens the model’s perception and robustness in complex backgrounds by enabling intra-group channel interaction and cross-group context fusion. Experimental results on a self-constructed dataset comprising various types of PV defects demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms YOLOv11n and other mainstream lightweight detection algorithms in terms of mAP, precision, and recall, while maintaining high inference speed and deployment efficiency. This study verifies that the proposed method effectively balances detection accuracy and computational cost, offering a practical and efficient solution for intelligent quality inspection systems in industrial applications.},

A thin neck structure designed based on hybrid convolution technology is adopted to reduce model parameters and computational load further. A lightweight dynamic feature upsampling operator improves the feature map quality. Additionally, the regularized Gaussian distribution distance loss function is used to enhance the detection ability for small target defects. Experimental results show that the YOLOv8-FSD lightweight algorithm improves detection accuracy while significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational requirements compared to the original algorithm.

Firstly, it is improved on the basis of coordinate attention to obtain a LCA attention mechanism with a larger target range, which can enhance the sensing range of target features in addition to fully capturing feature information; secondly, the weighted bidirectional feature pyramid is used to balance the feature information with excessive pixel differences by assigning different weights, which is more conducive to multi-scale Fast fusion of features; finally, the usual coupled head of YOLO series is replaced with decoupled head, so that the task branch can be performed more accurately and the detection accuracy can be improved. The results of comparative experiments on the solar panel defect detection data set show that after the improvement of the algorithm, the overall precision is increased by 1.5\%, the recall rate is increased by 2.4\%, and the mAP is up to 95.5\%, which is 2.5\% higher than that before the improvement.

Infrared (IR) thermography imaging has recently been employed to detect defects in PV modules. However, classifying and understanding the nature of defects remain a significant challenge. To address this issue, this paper develops and compares two approaches: a Vision Transformer (ViT) model and five hybrid ViT models that combine the ViT model with various types of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. In this context, a database of IR thermographic images of faulty PV modules was constructed at two different locations: The UDES in Tipaza (Algeria), and the University of Jaen (Spain). After several inspections, the most commonly observed faults have been identified as short-circuits, dust accumulation, partial shading, and open circuit. The ViT model achieved an accuracy of 99.30~\% with an inference time of 1.51~s, while the hybrid ViT model achieved an accuracy of 98.73~\% with an inference time of 1.18~ms. Globally, the developed hybrid models have resulted in exceptionally improved classification performance. Furthermore, this research provided an opportunity to compare the effectiveness of using the transformer model alone versus combining it with ML algorithms.},

  abstract = {The growing popularity of solar panels is crucial for global decarbonization, but harsh environmental conditions can lead to defects such as cracks, fingerprints, and short circuits. Existing methods face the challenge of detecting multi-scale defects while maintaining real-time performance. This paper proposes a solar panel defect detection model, DCE-YOLO, based on YOLOv8. The model incorporates a C2f-DWR-DRB module for multi-scale feature extraction, where the parallel DRB branch models spatial symmetry through symmetric-rate dilated convolutions, improving robustness and consistency. The COT attention module strengthens long-range dependencies and fuses local and global contexts to achieve symmetric feature representation. The lightweight and efficient detection head improves detection speed and accuracy. The CIoU loss function is replaced with WIoU, and a non-monotonic dynamic focusing mechanism is used to mitigate the effect of low-quality samples. Experimental results show that compared with the YOLOv8 benchmark, DCE-YOLO achieves a 2.1\% performance improvement on mAP@50 and a 4.9\% performance improvement on mAP@50-95. Compared with recent methods, DCE-YOLO exhibits broader defect coverage, stronger robustness, and a better performance-efficiency balance, making it highly suitable for edge deployment. The synergistic interaction between the C2f-DWR-DRB module and COT attention enhances the detection of symmetric and multi-scale defects under real-world conditions.},

  abstract = {瓦形永磁铁氧体(磁瓦)是电机的重要组成器件,磁瓦的表面缺陷将直接影响到电机的使用性能及寿命,因此表面缺陷检测对于保证产品质量具有重要意义。随着深度学习技术在计算机视觉领域的成功,基于深度学习的方法被逐步应用于磁瓦的表面缺陷检测。目前所采用的方法均是需要大量有标签数据来训练深度神经网络模型的有监督学习方法,在数据集构建时工作量大、耗时长,难以适应生产过程中因市场需求变化、工艺流程优化等导致产品特征变化的实际应用场景。本文针对实际应用需求,基于半监督深度学习的方法进行磁瓦表面缺陷的检测,旨在利用深度神经网络强大的表示和学习能力的同时降低训练过程中对有标签数据的需求量。本文的主要研究内容如下:(1)设计并搭建了磁瓦在线图像采集系统。本文针对磁瓦的形态特征,设计并搭建了磁瓦在线图像采集系统,以STM32微处理器控制磁瓦检测的传动及定位系统,采用漫射照明方法,以树莓派控制相机拍摄磁瓦六个面的图像,实现图像采集功能,并对采集到的图像进行缺陷标注从而建立磁瓦表面缺陷检测数据集。(2)提出基于伪标签的半监督磁瓦表面缺陷检测算法。该算法包含两个模型:教师模型和学生模型,并且训练过程分为两个阶段:伪标签生成阶段和学生模型训练阶段。伪标签生成阶段基于直推式学习的思想对教师模型和无标签数据的伪标签进行交替式优化,从而得到高质量的伪标签。学生模型训练阶段利用生成的伪标签来帮助缺陷检测模型的训练。实验结果表明,在训练集中有标签样本的比例仅为4.4\%的情况下,本文的方法能够实现90.13\%的缺陷检测准确率,比有监督方法高5.42\%。(3)对缺陷检测模型进行压缩和部署。本文基于知识蒸馏的思想,将学生模型替换为轻量级的网络,而教师模型仍然采用复杂的网络,从而能够在不显著降低模型性能的情况下实现对缺陷检测模型的压缩。利用深度学习推理框架MNN将压缩后的模型在树莓派上进行部署,实验结果表明压缩后的模型在树莓派上的推理时间为仅为42 ms,能够满足对实时性的要求。},

  abstract = {In recent years, solar energy has emerged as a pillar of sustainable development. However, maintaining panel efficiency under extreme environmental conditions remains a persistent hurdle. This study introduces an automated defect detection pipeline that leverages deep learning and computer vision to identify five standard anomaly classes: Non-Defective, Dust, Defective, Physical Damage, and Snow on photovoltaic surfaces. To build a robust foundation, a heterogeneous dataset of 8973 images was sourced from public repositories and standardized into a uniform labeling scheme. This dataset was then expanded through an aggressive augmentation strategy, including flips, rotations, zooms, and noise injections. A YOLOv11-based model was trained and fine-tuned using both fixed and adaptive learning rate schedules, achieving a mAP@0.5 of 85\% and accuracy, recall, and F1-score above 95\% when evaluated across diverse lighting and dust scenarios. The optimized model is integrated into an interactive dashboard that processes live camera streams, issues real-time alerts upon defect detection, and supports proactive maintenance scheduling. Comparative evaluations highlight the superiority of this approach over manual inspections and earlier YOLO versions in both precision and inference speed, making it well suited for deployment on edge devices. Automating visual inspection not only reduces labor costs and operational downtime but also enhances the longevity of solar installations. By offering a scalable solution for continuous monitoring, this work contributes to improving the reliability and cost-effectiveness of large-scale solar energy systems.},

  abstract = {Compared with conventional targets, small objects often face challenges such as smaller size, lower resolution, weaker contrast, and more background interference, making their detection more difficult. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved small object detection method based on the YOLO11 model—PC-YOLO11s. The core innovation of PC-YOLO11s lies in the optimization of the detection network structure, which includes the following aspects: Firstly, PC-YOLO11s has adjusted the hierarchical structure of the detection network and added a P2 layer specifically for small object detection. By extracting the feature information of small objects in the high-resolution stage of the image, the P2 layer helps the network better capture small objects. At the same time, in order to reduce unnecessary calculations and lower the complexity of the model, we removed the P5 layer. In addition, we have introduced the coordinate spatial attention mechanism, which can help the network more accurately obtain the spatial and positional features required for small targets, thereby further improving detection accuracy. In the VisDrone2019 datasets, experimental results show that PC-YOLO11s outperforms other existing YOLO-series models in overall performance. Compared with the baseline YOLO11s model, PC-YOLO11s mAP@0.5 increased from 39.5\% to 43.8\%, mAP@0.5:0.95 increased from 23.6\% to 26.3\%, and the parameter count decreased from 9.416M to 7.103M. Not only that, we also applied PC-YOLO11s to tea bud datasets, and experiments showed that its performance is superior to other YOLO-series models. Experiments have shown that PC-YOLO11s exhibits excellent performance in small object detection tasks, with strong accuracy improvement and good generalization ability, which can meet the needs of small object detection in practical applications.},

  abstract = {当前,化纤生产过程已经达到很高的自动化程度,然而化纤产品的质量检测仍然大量依靠人工检测,效率低、易出错,漏检的瑕疵产品为下游织造产品带来质量问题。其检测环节自动化水平的提高是当前化纤生产急需解决的问题。现有化纤丝锭缺陷的自动检测方法对油污、纸管破损等缺陷检测效果较好,但是对毛丝、绊丝等缺陷的检测效果较差,检测时存在“拍不清”和“检测难”等问题。针对上述问题,本文搭建了丝锭产品的图像检测系统,以小角度宽景深成像系统结合基于深度学习的图像处理技术实现化纤丝锭的瑕疵检测。主要研究内容如下: (1)针对丝锭毛丝缺陷的形态特征和拍不清、拍不全的问题,本文设计了小角度宽景深成像系统,并搭建了丝锭缺陷的图像检测装置。该系统能够增大成像景深对潜在缺陷区域的覆盖;检测装置由控制系统、成像采集系统、光环境控制模块、工控机等部分组成,能够实时采集丝锭图像并实现图像检测算法。 (2)针对图像标签的不准确性问题,本文提出基于弱监督学习的丝锭表面缺陷检测算法。该算法能够使用不准确的标签训练样本,通过“分类器-修正器”的架构,在训练过程中动态地修正标签,使检测模型获得接近真实标签的监督效果。实验结果表明,该算法在初始标签准确率72.38\%的情况下,能够训练出准确率94.55\%的检测模型,准确率相较于初始标签提升了35.81\%,该算法极大地降低了深度学习模型对训练标签质量的要求。在此基础上,为了适应训练集的特点,本文提出基于改进过拟合及损失函数的U-Net模型作为分类器模型,并结合稠密条件随机场修正器,其准确率比全监督算法训练的Res Net-50高4.28\%。 (3)针对图像检测算法的实时性问题,本文采用结构化知识蒸馏算法,根据教师模型与学生模型在特征图上的差异获得训练损失,以区域蒸馏的方法进一步增强对于Ground Truth的利用效率。实验结果表明在原模型准确率94.55\%的情况下,本文压缩算法能够以2.22\%的准确率损失,将模型大小压缩74.92\%。},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of renewable energy, surface defect detection of photovoltaic panels has become an important link in improving photoelectric conversion efficiency and ensuring safety. However, there are various types of surface defects on photovoltaic panels with complex backgrounds, and traditional detection methods face challenges such as low efficiency and insufficient accuracy. This article proposes a lightweight improved model AE-YOLO (YOLOv11+Adown +ECA) based on YOLOv11, which improves detection performance and efficiency by introducing a lightweight dynamic down-sampling module (Adown) and an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA). The Adown module reduces the complexity of computational and parameters through steps such as average pooling preprocessing, channel dimension segmentation, branch feature processing, and feature fusion. The ECA mechanism enhances the model’s response to defect sensitive feature channels and improves its ability to discriminate low contrast small defects through adaptive average pooling, one-dimensional convolution, and sigmoid activation. The experimental results indicate that the AE-YOLO model performs well on the PVEL-AD dataset. mAP@0.5 reached 90.3\%, the parameter count decreased by 18.7\%, the computational load decreased by 19\%, and the inference speed reached 259.56 FPS. The ablation experiment further validated the complementarity between Adown and ECA modules, providing an innovative solution for real-time and accurate defect detection of photovoltaic panels in industrial scenarios.},
